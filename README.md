# BSPD
Here is the BPSD I worked on for Clarkson Formula Electric. The Schematic is a modified version of the FSG Reference Schematic. As noted on the FSAE subreddit, the reset time was shorter than 10 seconds, so a 1 Mohm resistor was placed in the reset timing circuit to slow the reset down. This is not required for FSAE but was left in the circuit. MOSFETs were replaced with FETS we were already using in other circuit boards to minumize the amount of components that we need to order. The connectors were also switched over to molex microfit sieres as these are the series of connectors we are using on other boards. 
PCB layout is original.
Design files are all in Altium designer.
This board takes in two signals, a brake transducer and a current sensor. If hard braking is applied i.e the brake transducer is above a sertain threshold, and the current sensor reads a value over a set KW limit then this circuit will shut down the FSAE electric car. These thresholds are set by two potentiometers and can be adjusted as needed depending on what current sensor or brake transducer you are using. The sensors need to be above a .5v threshold or the BSPD will read that the a sensor is shorted and will not close the shutdown circuit. The BSPD gives out a 5 volt signal when sensors are in range to close a relay in the shutdown circuit.
This board has been tested in the lab and outputs as expected. It has not been tested with the sensors chosen, just with standard lab equipment.
